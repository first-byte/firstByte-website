						We will go over the focus of my work for the last half-year where I've been designing components to enable our Operational teams to build more performant, accessible and supportable products. My department has a unique story when it comes to components because we don't build a singular product, we build highly customized websites for our clients atop of our singular CMS product and so our components are heavily tied into the systems of our CMS, but also generic enough to be used in a number of different contexts to fit a number of client needs.<br>

						<b>Tech Talk</b><br>
						This talk will be about software that flies airplanes. In a relaxed discussion-based setting, we will explain both what this software does and how our engineers develop it. In the Aerospace industry, guiding principles for software development define both the product and the process. At Honeywell, we develop software for Aerospace applications which means we have a different way of thinking about software solutions. When safety is the only priority, questions about memory and space require different answers.  It is in this environment that we push the bounds of what aircraft flight looks like today, and find better solutions to what it will look like tomorrow. This talk will hinge on how to develop software for highly sensitive embedded systems, how communication between software and hardware is facilitated, and how to innovate in an environment that has rigid standards for human safety. We will be discussing how today’s software controls aircraft flight, route planning algorithms bounded by physical laws, and innovation as a means to overcoming physical constraints of a system.<br>
